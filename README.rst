This was a wild idea popping into a curious mind without prior adequate mathematical knowledge nor the patience
to continue collecting science of the topic of computer graphics. This project is mostly finished except the
resultant image is horrendous, interpolation would be the solution. But laziness took priority, thus here it
exists being a project that crashed in its first flight. If you are willing to support, make an issue or
pull-request.
